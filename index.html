# Pidgin English

In the process of learning Pidgin English I have found few good dictionaries to help me.
Perhaps, it's a good reason to try and create one.

Please help expanding this Open Source dictionary by [submitting a Pull Request to the GitHub repository.](https://github.com/oyin-bo/oyin.bo)

## Existing dictionaries

1. [Naijalingo.com](http://naijalingo.com/), the famous one (but nowhere complete!)
2. ?
3. ???
