# TF?

It seems social media is not a good tool for expression.

Good one for finding interesting people, and sometimes
good for learning too. But it de-focuses you so much.
I think I should go back to blogging, and old style Web.

Here you go then. A website.

# Oyin.what??

Oyinbo is a Nigerian Pidgin English word for European/white person.

In awfully many aspects and contexts white is the default race.
If you say 'black president' or 'black actor' it sounds normal.
But say 'white president' or 'white actor', and something's off.

That's why I'm consciously trying to keep being aware of my race.
I am not just a normal default person, I am oyinbo. I can't shed my whiteness,
so I better keep an eye on it.

One day it will not be important, but it is now.

# And so what?

As a great writer [Deesha Philyaw](twitter.com/DeeshaPhilyaw) teaches,
narrative needs reasons, if your story cannot answer 'so what?' it isn't
a well written story.

And so, there is no good answer here.

In a bit I hope to have it. The so what thing.
For now you walked into a dud, my friend. Bye!
